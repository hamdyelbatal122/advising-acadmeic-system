         <p>
            Academic Advising is defined as a process that aims to help the student discover his
            abilities and potentials with the aim of assisting him in making decisions related to his study plan,
            choosing the appropriate type of academic major, and helping him overcome the difficulties
            that may obstruct his academic path. For this purpose, the educational departments
            provide a faculty member/teaching assistant as an academic advisor for each student during
            his or her academic path. The departmentâ€™s students are divided into small groups and each
            group of students has an academic advisor.
